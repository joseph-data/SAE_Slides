## The Challenge: Traditional Surveys Fall Short in Small Areas

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) require precise, local-level labor market statistics for effective policy interventions and resource allocation. However, national surveys like Labor Force Survey (LFS) often have insufficient sample sizes for small areas.

-   Direct estimates for many smaller domains are often too unreliable for publication or, as in the case of Goltand, entirely.

Set the context fast. This is a real official statistics problem.

-   For example, the Swedish LFS did not report estimates for Gotland County due to having fewer than 40 quarterly observations.
-   This leads to high sampling variance and wide margins of error for disaggregated estimates.
-   In extreme cases, estimates are suppressed ent

## Borrowing Strength with Small Area Estimation

-   Small Area Estimation (SAE) is a set of statistical techniques that produce reliable estimates for small domains by combining the survey data with auxiliary information.

    ![](images/paste-5.png)

-   There are two main broad categories of models under SAE:

    1.  Area- Level Models
    2.  Unit Level Models

<!-- -   This research employs the Fay-Herriot (FH) model,
    a well-established hierarchical model in official statistics. -->

## Fay-Herriot (FH) Area-Level Model to Estimate County Unemployment Rates

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Direct Estimates** ($\hat{y_i}$)- Used Q1 2025 LFS direct unemployment rates from SCB and their sampling variances for th 20 of 21 Swedish Counties.
-   **Auxiliary Data** ($X'_i$) - A set of geospatial and administrative covariates for the 21 counties.

**Model Framework**

1.  **Sampling Model:** $$\hat{y_i} = \theta_i + e_i$$

-   $\theta_i$ is the true, unknown value of unemployment rate of area $i$

<!-- -->

-   $e_i$ is sampling error (uncertainity inherent in the survey strategy)
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
2.  **Linking Model:** $$\theta_i = X_i^\top\beta + \mu_i$$

-   $\beta$ represents a vector of unknown regression coeﬀicients, assumed to be constant across all areas $i$.

<!-- -->

-   $u_i$ is denotes the area-specific random effect for area $i$.

3.  **Prediction: Emprical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (EBLUP)**

$$
\tilde{\theta}_i
= \gamma_i y_i + (1 - \gamma_i)\, x_i^\top \beta
$$

The weight $\gamma_i$ is the shrinkage factor, defined as:

$$
\gamma_i
= \frac{\sigma_u^2}{\sigma_u^2 + \psi_i}
$$
