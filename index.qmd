## The Challenge: Traditional Surveys Fall Short in Small Areas

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) require precise, local-level labor market statistics for effective policy interventions and resource allocation. However, national surveys like Labor Force Survey (LFS) often have insufficient sample sizes for small areas.

-   Direct estimates for many smaller domains are often too unreliable for publication or, as in the case of Goltand, entirely.

Set the context fast. This is a real official statistics problem.

-   For example, the Swedish LFS did not report estimates for Gotland County due to having fewer than 40 quarterly observations.
-   This leads to high sampling variance and wide margins of error for disaggregated estimates.
-   In extreme cases, estimates are suppressed ent

## Borrowing Strength with Small Area Estimation

-   Small Area Estimation (SAE) is a set of statistical techniques that produce reliable estimates for small domains by combining the survey data with auxiliary information.

    ![](images/paste-5.png)

-   There are two main broad categories of models under SAE:

    1.  Area- Level Models
    2.  Unit Level Models

```{=html}
<!-- -   This research employs the Fay-Herriot (FH) model,
    a well-established hierarchical model in official statistics. -->

## Fay-Herriot (FH) Area-Level Model to Estimate County Unemployment Rates

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Direct Estimates** ($\hat{y_i}$)- Used Q1 2025 LFS direct unemployment rates from SCB and their sampling variances for th 20 of 21 Swedish Counties.
-   **Auxiliary Data** ($X'_i$) - A set of geospatial and administrative covariates for the 21 counties.

**Model Framework**

1.  **Sampling Model:** $$\hat{y_i} = \theta_i + e_i$$

-   $\theta_i$ is the true, unknown value of unemployment rate of area $i$

<!-- -->

-   $e_i$ is sampling error (uncertainity inherent in the survey strategy)
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
2.  **Linking Model:** $$\theta_i = X_i^\top\beta + \mu_i$$

-   $\beta$ represents a vector of unknown regression coeﬀicients, assumed to be constant across all areas $i$.

<!-- -->

-   $u_i$ is denotes the area-specific random effect for area $i$.

3.  **Prediction: Emprical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (EBLUP)**

$$
\tilde{\theta}_i
= \gamma_i y_i + (1 - \gamma_i)\, x_i^\top \beta
$$

The weight $\gamma_i$ is the shrinkage factor, defined as:

$$
\gamma_i
= \frac{\sigma_u^2}{\sigma_u^2 + \psi_i}
$$

## Data & Workflow Process

# Results

## Stepwise Selection Identified four key geospatial covariates

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Initial Analysis revealed high collinearity among several potential covariates. ![](images/paste-11.png)

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Stepwise regression model is used to reduce the model by checking the AIC/BIC values. The final model retained four key predictors.

    ![](images/paste-14.png){width="725"}

-   The reduced model had an $R²$ of 0.95 with lowest AIC (-109.58) and BIC (-103.60)

Table 4.1 shows that the reduced original scale FH model with log elevation, slope, population density and urban cover percentage is the preferred model. The model, had better overall fit when examining the AIC and BIC values. The transformed models did not outperform the original and introduces uncertainties due to back-transformation. The original scale model strikes a good balance between parsimony and explanatory power and is preferred in this study in the production of county-level estimates.

## FH model delivered substantial gains in precision over the direct estimates

-   The model-based estimates consistently showed lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Coefficient of Variation (CV), indicating significant improvement in reliability.

## Direct vs. Model Based Estimates

-   The model based estimates show lower CVs across nearly all counties, with huge improvements in the areas where direct estimates were previously uncertain.

## Diagnostic checks for robustness

-   The reliability of the model-based estimates depends on the validility of the underlying statistical assumption.

-   Normality: Q-Q Plots of residuals and random effects show close adherence to a normal distribution.

-   Formal Tests: The Shapiro-Wilk test fails to reject the null hypothesis of normality for both standardized residuals (p = 0.70) and random effects (p = 0.64).
