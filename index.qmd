## The Challenge: Traditional Surveys Fall Short in Small Areas

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates at disaggretated level have high variance, limitig reliability.

-   For small domains like counties or municipalities, direct estimates are often unreliable due to insufficient sample sizes.

::: notes
Set the context fast. This is a real official statistics problem.

-   For example, the Swedish LFS did not report estimates for Gotland County due to having fewer than 40 quarterly observations.
-   This leads to high sampling variance and wide margins of error for disaggregated estimates.
-   In extreme cases, estimates are suppressed ent

## Borrowing Strength with Small Area Estimation

-   Small Area Estimation (SAE) is a set of statistical techniques that produce reliable estimates for small domains by combining the survey data with auxiliary information.

    ![](images/paste-5.png)

-   There are two main broad categories of models under SAE:

    1.  Area- Level Models
    2.  Unit Level Models

```{=html}
<!-- -   This research employs the Fay-Herriot (FH) model,
    a well-established hierarchical model in official statistics. -->

## Contribution of the Thesis

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Traditional SAE relies on administrative data or registers.
-   We explored the value of integrating satellite-derived geospatial data.

## We Applied a Fay-Herriot (FH) Area-Level Model

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Direct Estimates** ($\hat{y_i}$)- Used Q1 2025 LFS direct unemployment rates from SCB and their sampling variances for th 20 of 21 Swedish Counties.
-   **Auxiliary Data** ($X'_i$) - A set of geospatial and administrative covariates for the 21 counties.

::: {.column width="10%"}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Model Framework**

**Sampling Model:** $$\hat{y_i} = \theta_i + e_i$$

-   $\theta_i$ is the true, unknown value of unemployment rate of area $i$

<!-- -->

-   $e_i$ is sampling error (uncertainity inherent in the survey strategy)

**Linking Model:** $$\theta_i = X_i^\top\beta + \mu_i$$


-   $\beta$ represents a vector of unknown regression coeﬀicients, assumed to be constant across all areas $i$.

<!-- -->

-   $u_i$ is denotes the area-specific random effect for area $i$.
