## The Challenge: Traditional Surveys Fall Short in Small Areas

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates at disaggretated level have high variance, limitig reliability.

-   For small domains like counties or municipalities, direct estimates are often unreliable due to insufficient sample sizes.

::: notes
Set the context fast. This is a real official statistics problem.

-   For example, the Swedish LFS did not report estimates for Gotland County due to having fewer than 40 quarterly observations.
-   This leads to high sampling variance and wide margins of error for disaggregated estimates.
-   In extreme cases, estimates are suppressed ent

## Borrowing Strength with Small Area Estimation

-   Small Area Estimation (SAE) is a set of statistical techniques that produce reliable estimates for small domains by combining the survey data with auxiliary information.

-   There are two main broad categories of models under SAE:

    1.  Area- Level Models
    2.  Unit Level Models

<!-- -   This research employs the Fay-Herriot (FH) model,
    a well-established hierarchical model in official statistics. -->

## Contribution of the Thesis

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Traditional SAE relies on administrative data or registers.
- We explored the value of integrating satellite-derived geospatial data.

## We Applied a Fay-Herriot (FH) Area-Level Model

1.  **Direct Estimates** ($\hat{y_i}$)- Used Q1 2025 LFS direct unemployment rates from SCB and their sampling variances for the 20 of 21 Swedish Counties.
2.  **Auxiliary Data** ($X'_i$) - A set of geospatial and administrative covariates for the 21 counties.
3.  **Model Framework** -
